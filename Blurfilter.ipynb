    "Filtering primarily involves performing an operation on a neighborhood of pixels for image enhancement. This operation creates a new value for the pixel and that value is at the coordinate position equal to the center of the neighborhood. There are two broad types of filtering based on the domain they are done in - spatial filtering and frequency filtering. In this exercise, the blur filters used are those that operate in the spatial domain. There are further divisions depending on the kernel types, such as separable or non-separable, linear or non-linear, etc., Filtering is used in a wide range of applications while the most common in image processing is to use this technique in preprocessing steps mainly for blurring the image or sharpening the image. Blurring is nothing but smoothing the image and is equivalent to a low pass filter, avoids high frequency/intensity components and as a result, blurs the edges also to some extent. In this exercise, we implement few simple blurring filters and study their effects on a set of images (stored in the 'Test_Images' folder).\n",
